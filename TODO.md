- [ ] Have helicoptors randomly spawn
- [ ] Sort out removing elements
- [ ] Collision between two objects
- [ ] Score increasing and decreasing
- [ ] Add error handling for the turret movement to restrict movement
- [ ] Sort file structure so that pictures are in a directory
- [ ] Extract js to a different file
- [ ] Scroll wheel controls
- [ ] investigate how things are drawn frame by frame and see if we need to do .onload for each image
- [ ] Have turret extend from bullet maybe since they have the same display method ? [I might investigate how to do the conservatory thing where you just use that method]
- [ ] Find a way to flip helicoptor sprite with the same file
